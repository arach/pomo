## Development Usage

### Testing V2 Watchfaces

Use the split-view comparison tool to see V1 and V2 side-by-side:

```
http://localhost:1421/?split=true
```

Features:
- Side-by-side V1/V2 comparison
- Theme selector dropdown
- Real-time theme switching
- Visual difference highlighting

### Version Parameter

You can force a specific version in the regular view:

```
http://localhost:1421/?version=v2
```

### Creating New V2 Components

When creating V2 versions of watchface components:

1. Create a `v2/` subdirectory in the watchface folder
2. Name the component with V2 suffix (e.g., `TerminalProgressV2.tsx`)
3. Add the V2 badge indicator
4. Register in `WatchFaceRenderer.tsx` v2Components map
5. Implement the renderV2Component pattern

## Design Principles

### V2 Enhancement Guidelines

1. **Maintain Identity** - Keep the core character of each watchface
2. **Add Polish** - Enhance with modern effects and animations
3. **Improve Readability** - Better contrast and typography
4. **Performance** - Keep animations smooth and efficient
5. **Consistency** - All V2 watchfaces should have the V2 badge

### Common V2 Features

- V2 badge indicator (usually top-right)
- Enhanced animations and transitions
- Better use of gradients and shadows
- Improved hover/interaction states
- More refined color schemes

## Future Considerations

- User preferences for V1/V2 selection
- Additional V2 themes
- Custom V2 component creation in watchface JSON
- Performance profiling for complex effects
