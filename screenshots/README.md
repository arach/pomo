# Screenshots

Please add the following screenshots to this directory:

1. **expanded-view.png** - The full timer view showing:
   - The circular progress indicator with gradient
   - Timer display (25:00)
   - "Ready" status text
   - Control buttons (play, stop, reset)
   - Settings gear icon in top right
   - Beautiful dark theme with transparency

2. **collapsed-view.png** - The minimal collapsed view showing:
   - Just the timer (25:00) 
   - Play and stop buttons
   - Ultra-compact horizontal layout
   - Perfect for staying out of the way

3. **app-screenshot.png** (optional) - A hero shot showing the timer in use

Both screenshots should capture the app's elegant dark theme, subtle transparency effects, and the window shadow for that floating appearance.
